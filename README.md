# 97Games

An Educational Blog for Game Development wth Scratch (German)

## Motivation

Learning to code is hard. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) makes it easy to start. But missing were easy to
understand tutorials in German (Scratch is intended for children age ten and up) to get future developers hooked on
the topic. The main topic of the blog is game development, which is a good motivator.
